  Project Overview: The "Predictive Modeling for Revenue" project aims to develop an AI-based model that predicts future revenue based on historical data. By leveraging machine learning regression techniques, our model analyzes key factors such as marketing spend, sales volume, customer data, and seasonal trends to predict revenue outcomes with high accuracy.
                    The project involves:
                    Data preprocessing and cleaning
                    Feature engineering and selection
                    Building a regression model using Linear Regression (with options for more advanced models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting)
                    Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²)
                    Visualizing predictions through graphs and plots
